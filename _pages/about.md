I am an algorithm engineer of [Leapmotor Technology](https://www.leapmotor.com/home) since July 2021. Previously I spent seven wounderful years and obtained my Master's Degree and Bachelor's Degree at [Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology](https://www.nuist.edu.cn/main.htm) respectively, supervised by [Qingshan Liu](https://faculty.nuist.edu.cn/liuqingshan/zh_CN/index.htm). My current research is mainly focused on general 3D perception, including semantic segmentation and object detection for point cloud.
